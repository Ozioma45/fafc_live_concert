# I Will Be There - Flyer Creator

Welcome to the official **"I Will Be There" Flyer Generator**! 🎉

This web app was built to help attendees of the **Hallujah** musical concert (organized by the **Paradise Band of CHC int'l Umuonaje Asaba**) easily personalize, download, and share their own event flyers — without needing manual editing by the design team.

## 📜 Project Purpose

The **"I Will Be There"** flyer was originally designed by Me.  
As requests for personalized flyers grew larger and more time-consuming, this tool was created to **allow everyone to generate their own flyers instantly** by:

- Uploading their **passport photo**.
- Typing their **name**.
- **Adjusting** image placement if needed.
- **Previewing** the final flyer.
- **Downloading** or **sharing** their customized flyer immediately.

This saves hours of manual design work and gives everyone a beautiful, consistent flyer to promote the event on social media.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Upload your passport photo** — it automatically fits into the flyer frame.
2. **Type your name** — it appears neatly in the designated space.
3. **Adjust your photo** inside the frame if needed.
4. **Preview your flyer** before downloading.
5. **Download** or **Share** your finished flyer with one click!
6. **Celebrate** with a special popup and sound effect after download!

✅ **Fully responsive design** (works on mobile, tablet, and desktop).  
✅ **High-resolution flyer** (perfect for Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, etc).  
✅ **Simple video tutorial** available for first-time users.  
✅ **Invitation link popup** for inviting more friends easily.
